To account for range loops not including the top value, I added +1 to all the
day values in post, instead of just saying 31 day months technically have a 32
day cap. Initially every MaxDay assignment was a for loop but it made it more
readable to put the magic date filler at the end and only assign day limits when
months were accounted for.

Create empty list of magic dates, month names (readability), 31 day months,  MaxDays integer

First, over every year:

       Check whether the month has 31 days -> assign 31 days to MaxDay

       We check whether the Month is February:

       	  We check whether the year is a leap year -> We set MaxDay to 29

	  If it's not a leap year -> We set MaxDay to 28

       The only remaining months have 30 days -> set MaxDay to 30

       For each day in the month:
              
       	   if the month * day is equal to the last two digits of the year:
	   
	      Add it to the Year list

With the Year list filled with magic dates, we can now return it to main
