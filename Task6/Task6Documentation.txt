Classic prime algorithm:
1 and 2 are handled as edge cases, the function counts from 2 till the value before the
number. If any can perfectly divide into the number being tested (ie num % x == 0),
the function has found a factor of prime, and returns false.
If no factors are found, it returns true.

People calling these functions typically expect boolean return types,
but prewritten print statements make output more readable.
