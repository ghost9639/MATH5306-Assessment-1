I am a c and java programmer, I prefer to handle issues using data storage systems and objects.
This caroler function defines two lists, the lyrics (1 -> 12) and the days (1 -> 12).
Since the first day only has the partridge, it's handled separately at the beginning.
A daysPassed variable is used to count the number of days, moving up the list.
A temp variable borrows daysPassed,it starts at the day's position in the list of gifts,
and moves down to 0 (first index)

basically

for each day from 1 to 12:
    count down gifts from day
