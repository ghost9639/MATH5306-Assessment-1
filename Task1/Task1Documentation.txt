We can make a simple median algorithm for three numbers by sorting the list.
Python tuple assignment makes reading the program very easy, and the print
statement is broken across two lines to avoid breaking the 78 character limit.
The sorting algorithm swaps any numbers higher in value than a number of
higher index.
